# Excel-Portfolio
In this project, I cleaned a large dataset of Bike Sales data with 1000 rows. This Excel file includes different sheets with the raw data, the cleaned data (i.e., working sheet), pivot tables, dashboard and finally a brief explanation of my work process on the dataset. This portfolio project demonstrates my skills in using data cleaning methods in Excel as well as using formulas, creating interactive pivot tables and dynamic dashboards for data presentations.
